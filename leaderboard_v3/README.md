The widget is fully editable, re-adjustable, multilingual (all languages are supported), units of measure are also auto-generated by the system (all the currencies are pre defined in your private space) and it is a complementary product that gives the player a full in-depth gaming experience. All you have to do is:

## FAQ
### How to show game/product specific competitions only:
```text
The setting "enforceGameLookup" should be set to "true" and game/product ID should be assigned to the setting entry "gameId" part of the widget startup/initialisation
{
  enforceGameLookup: true,
  gameId: "my_id"
}
```

### How to show the widget only if there are any available competitions:
```text
The primary method “this.startup“ inside the "LbWidget" class is the one you should adjust to implement your scenario to achieve a pre-launch check, you can wrap what's inside of that method with the function:
this.checkForAvailableCompetitions()
This method collects all the necessary information about active, ready and finished competitions (example: _this.settings.tournaments.readyCompetitions will contain a list of upcoming competitions) so you can use the callback and the collected information to decide to show or hide the mini-scoreboard on startup based on your requirements.
```

### How do I only show the competition tab if there is an active competition only and/or change the default tab to the achievements tab

The current flow is:
1) once the mini scoreboard is clicked, the main layout gets initialized (unless it’s already not existing in the DOM)
2) the navigation then gets reset to the initial competition tab

To achieve this scenario you would need to do an available competition check prior to the navigation reset and then hide/show tabs accordingly based on your business requirement.
The code of interest would be on line inside the method called: "this.initLayout" in the "MainWidget" widget class, the method that resets the navigation is "_this.resetNavigation( callback )" this handles what navigation item to set as default for the user.
You can either change this code directly or override that method after initialization inside the "this.startup" method for the class "LbWidget" by doing the following "_this.settings.mainWidget.resetNavigation = function(callback){}". 
There you can write some logic that would check what tabs to show/hide. 
Or you can overwrite this on a more global scope level where you initialize the widget "new LbWidget(window._CLLBV3Opt)" as you get full access to the settings and all other methods.


### Localization - How do I translate the widget UI:
To enable translation the following steps need to be made:
1) Translate your UI elements to the appropriate language and save it in a ".json" format using the following naming pattern `translation_en.json` [JSON example](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo.competitionlabs.com/_widgets/leaderboard_v3/i18n/translation_en.json)
2) The translations you define inside the file will be merged with the core translations on run time

```text
* The default widget language is set to english "en", the widget will try to load look for an external translation 
resource based on the language setting and the "translationPath"

* If the resource path is used as "translation_:language.json" the widget script will try to replace ":language" with the 
current language  setting and load the translation dynamically from an external source, example:
https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo.competitionlabs.com/_widgets/leaderboard_v3/i18n/translation_:language.json
```
